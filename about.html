                Before the World Wide Web dominated the internet, Bulletin Board Systems (BBSs) 
                were the primary way for computer enthusiasts to connect and share information. 
                Users would dial in using modems, often waiting for busy signals, to access 
                these digital communities.
            </p>
            <p>
                BBSs offered message boards, file downloads, and most memorably, "door games" - 
                external programs that provided interactive entertainment. These games were often 
                the main attraction, drawing users back day after day.

            <h2>📝 What Were Door Games?</h2>
            <p>
                Door games were called "doors" because they were external programs that users 
                could "enter" from the main BBS menu. When a user selected a door game, they 
                would temporarily leave the BBS software and enter the game's interface.

                This web-based recreation captures the essence of BBS door games while adapting 
                them for modern browsers. The games are built with:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Python/Flask Backend:</strong> Game logic and session management</li>
                <li><strong>WebSocket Communication:</strong> Real-time interaction between browser and server</li>
                <li><strong>Retro Styling:</strong> CSS that mimics classic terminal interfaces</li>
                <li><strong>Persistent Data:</strong> Player progress saved between sessions</li>

            <h2>💭 Why This Matters</h2>
            <p>
                BBS door games represent a unique period in computing history when online 
                communities were small, personal, and innovative. They pioneered many concepts 
                we take for granted today: persistent online worlds, user-generated content, 
                and social gaming.

                This project preserves that spirit for new generations while allowing veterans 
                to relive the magic of dialing into their favorite BBS at 2 AM to check if 
                they'd been killed in Trade Wars overnight.
